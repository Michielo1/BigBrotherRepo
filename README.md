# Description

**BigBrother** is all about securing your minecraft server. It includes a **machine learning algorithm** to detect insults and stop them from being sent. This means that it does **not** just **look at a certain library of bad words**. The default dataset is optimized for English and may flag incorrectly with other languages - but you can just edit or create your own!

For the **Anti-VPN** module we use **2 API's** (Proxycheck and KauriVPN) which both include a free plan of 1000 and 20000 **free queries** a month respectively. You don't even need to create an account to get access to the 20000 queries a month!

Currently we support **alt-detection based on IP**. In the future this will get updated with other added methods to catch as many alts as we can realistically get.

As **extra security** we currently have one mode which is **Permission based**. If a connection is made from a minecraft account that has OP or all permission while the IP is unfamiliar, we **blacklist** the IP until a command is executed in console or in-game to whitelist the IP. This is just extra protection and not needed if your server is in online-mode.
